# README for NBA Database Project

## Overview

This project contains a database for managing NBA-related data. The database includes several SQL scripts and documents to define, manipulate, and query the data. 
The files provided cover database creation, data insertion, and query examples, along with a reverse diagram for visual reference.

**Getting Started**

To set up and use the NBA database, follow these steps:

**Database Setup**

Execute the NBA_DDL(1).sql script to create the database schema.
Ensure you have a SQL database management system (DBMS) installed, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.


**Data Insertion**

Execute the NBA_DML(1).sql script to insert initial data into the database.
This script will populate the tables with sample NBA data.

**Querying the Database**

Use the NBA_SQLStatement.sql script to perform various queries on the database.
This script includes examples of how to retrieve and manipulate data.

**Review the Diagram**


Refer to reverse diagram.png to understand the structure and relationships within the database.
